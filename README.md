# NumPy in the classroom

45 min lecture

**Pre-reqs**: Basic Python knwoledge + interest in NumPy and education

## Description

In this session, I discuss the benefits of using NumPy in engineering courses. Students build solutions using Python, learn to share resources, and creatively add to the course  content. NumPy is an open source software that accelerates array-based computing in Python. I can build course materials that incorporate, improve, and share all of these open resources and students are directly involved in the process. I have used NumPy with individual student research, large (>200 students) courses, and small (<20 students) Summer courses. I'll discuss lessons learned and key strategies I use to motivate and engage new Python users.

## Exercises:

### 1. What was something you did in a course that you _never_ shared?
_examples: a paper, an exam, a homework assignment_

|course| your _secret_ product|
|---| ---|

### 2. What was something you did in a course that you were excited/happy to share? 
_examples: a paper, a video you made, a homework assignment_

### 3. When you shared something, what is something you learned?

|course| your product|
|---| ---|
